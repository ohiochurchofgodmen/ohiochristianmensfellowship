The Men's ministry hosted a spiritual retreat to do just that. Since then,\n\t\t\t\tthis retreat continue as the Ohio Christian Men's Fellowship.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tThe Ohio Christian Men's Fellowship is an event, in which Christian men gather in fellowship with one another. \n\t\t\t\tThis event has many different activities that both younger and older men can enjoy, such as golfing, fishing, horseshoes, and cornhole. \n\t\t\t\tYou will get to hear a great speaker, different every year, speaking about life as a Christian man in today's society. \n\t\t\t\tAfter the speaker, take a break and listen to some wonderful music and gather around the fire to share in faith with others. \n\t\t\t\tBefore the event is through, don't forget to stop by the merchandise tent to get a shirt to remember your time,\n\t\t\t\tor find a book that will inspire you in the year to come. The Ohio Christian Men's Fellowship is a time to grow in your \n\t\t\t\tfaith and meet other Christian's like yourself.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tThrough the Ohio Christian Men's Fellowship and other ministry activities, the Ohio Church of God Men have raised money for outreach and challenged countless \n\t\t\t\tnumbers of men and boys to serve the Lord. An executive council meets four times a year under President Lance Rose to plan the annual \n\t\t\t\tretreat and help keep this ministry group as one of the most successful in the country.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</section>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default IndexPage;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
