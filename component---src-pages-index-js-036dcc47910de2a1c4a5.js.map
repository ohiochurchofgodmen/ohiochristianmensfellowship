They would seek to live out the message and ministry of\n\t\t\t\t\treconciliation through corporate fellowship and mission by the grace of God. For many\n\t\t\t\t\tyears, the men&#39;s ministry hosted a spiritual retreat known as the Ohio Menâ€™s Ox Roast.\n\t\t\t\t\tToday, the fellowship, mission, and retreat continue as the Ohio Christian Men&#39;s\n\t\t\t\t\tFellowship.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Ohio Christian Men&#39;s Fellowship is an event, in which Christian men gather\n\t\t\t\t\tto engage in fellowship with one another. This event has many different activities that\n\t\t\t\t\tyounger and older men can enjoy. The event is broken into two days of activities with\n\t\t\t\t\tcabin accommodations included. Friday is the lighter of the two days and offers a more\n\t\t\t\t\trelaxed schedule. The highlights of Friday include the annual fishing tournament and\n\t\t\t\t\tthe evening bonfire and hotdog roast. Saturday has a packed schedule that includes:\n\t\t\t\t\tthree meals, devotional sessions, a sermon from an accomplished Christian speaker,\n\t\t\t\t\tworship with professional musicians, athletic tournaments, and loads of recreational\n\t\t\t\t\tactivities such as hiking, fishing, horseshoes, and cornhole. The Ohio Christian Men&#39;s\n\t\t\t\t\tFellowship is a time for men to grow in their faith, meet and fellowship with brothers in\n\t\t\t\t\tChrist, and invite others in your life to experience the love of Jesus Christ.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\tThrough the Ohio Christian Men&#39;s Fellowship, Christian men across the state of\n\t\t\t\t\tOhio have raised money for ministry outreach and challenged countless numbers of\n\t\t\t\t\tmen and boys to serve the Lord. The OCGM council meets multiple times per year,\n\t\t\t\t\tunder President Lance Rose, to plan the annual retreat and to continue the fellowship.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t</section>\n\t\t</Layout>\n\t);\n}\n\n\nexport default IndexPage;\n","// extracted by mini-css-extract-plugin\nmodule.exports = {\"scheduleButton\":\"index-module--scheduleButton--12mlT\"};"],"sourceRoot":""}
