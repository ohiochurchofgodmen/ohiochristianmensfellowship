              {`When the Ohio Church of God Men's ministry began in 1976, the
              members had a vision for all men in Ohio. They would seek to live
              out the message and ministry of reconciliation through corporate
              fellowship and mission by the grace of God. For many years, the
              men's ministry hosted a spiritual retreat known as the Ohio
              Menâ€™s Ox Roast. Today, the fellowship, mission, and retreat
              continue as the Ohio Christian Men's Fellowship.`}

              {`The Ohio Christian Men's Fellowship is an event, in which
              Christian men gather to engage in fellowship with one another.
              This event has many different activities that younger and older
              men can enjoy. The event is broken into two days of activities
              with cabin accommodations included. Friday is the lighter of the
              two days and offers a more relaxed schedule. The highlights of
              Friday include the annual fishing tournament and the evening
              bonfire and hotdog roast. Saturday has a packed schedule that
              includes: three meals, devotional sessions, a sermon from an
              accomplished Christian speaker, worship with professional
              musicians, athletic tournaments, and loads of recreational
              activities such as hiking, fishing, horseshoes, and cornhole. The
              Ohio Christian Men's Fellowship is a time for men to grow in
              their faith, meet and fellowship with brothers in Christ, and
              invite others in your life to experience the love of Jesus Christ.`}

              Lord. The OCGM council meets multiple times per year, under
